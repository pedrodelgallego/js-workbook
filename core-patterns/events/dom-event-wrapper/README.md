A DOM event wrapper
===================

Events are at the core of your JavaScript application, powering
everything and providing the first point of contact when a user
interacts with your application. However, this is where JavaScriptâ€™s
unstandardized birth rears its ugly head. At the height of the browser
wars, Netscape and Microsoft purposely chose different, incompatible
event models. Although they were later standardized by the W3C,
Internet Explorer kept its different implementation until its latest
release, IE9.
